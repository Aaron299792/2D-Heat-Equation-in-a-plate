# 2D-Heat-Equation-in-a-plate
Using the Crank Nicolson Method, we proposed a realtime solver-simulation of the 2-D Heat Equation valid for rectangular Geometries, we are tempted to propose other schemes of solution in the future with different methods and/or geometries. At this vary moment solutions are python based.
