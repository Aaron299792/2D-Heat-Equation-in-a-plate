# 2D-Heat-Equation-in-a-plate
Using the Crank Nicolson Method, we proposed a realtime solver-simulation of the 2-D Heat Equation valid for rectangular Geometries, we are tempted to propose other schemes of solution in the future with different methods and/or geometries. At this vary moment solutions are python based.

To run the code the following packages are required:

- Numpy (`pip install numpy`)
- Scipy (`pip install scipy`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
- Joblib (`pip install joblib`)

To run the code in bash you can use the following command:
`python3 heateq.py`

Otherwise, verify that your IDE or other tools contained the above mentioned packages.
